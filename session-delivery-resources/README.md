## Deployment / Preparation

>**What's Here?** Deploying the demo environment on Azure - including the prerequisites.

1. Follow the manual deployment steps in the [AI Agents Quick Start](https://github.com/Azure/azure-ai-agents) repo and deploy using the **basic-agent-keys.bicep** file to create an Azure AI Project.
2. At the time of writing the bicep deploys a **gpt-4o-mini** model. If you would like to work with another model supported by the Azure AI Agent service, you need to manually deployfrom the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) into the newly created project.
3. Follow the instructions to create to [Create an Agent connection string](https://github.com/Azure/azure-ai-agents/blob/main/quickstart.md#create-an-agent)
5. Set up the .env file variable **PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING** to the connection string you just created.
